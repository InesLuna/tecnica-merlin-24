# Technical Test

Created using [React + Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).

This Single Page Application was developed for a technical test.

It displays a list of podcasts, allowing users to filter by title and author. When clicking on a podcast, users can access a page that shows the details of that podcast, as well as view the list of the latest 20 published episodes.

React Router is used for client-side navigation, and Redux manages and stores the appâ€™s state on the client side.
